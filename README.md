## Environment Variables

To enable saving the current dashboard configuration as the default, set the
following variables in a `.env` file:

```
REACT_APP_DEFAULT_DASHBOARD_GIST_ID=<your_gist_id>
REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN=<github_personal_access_token>
```

If these values are not provided, the **Save as Default** button will be
disabled and attempts to save will log
`DEFAULT_DASHBOARD_GIST_ID not set; cannot update default dashboard` to the
console.
